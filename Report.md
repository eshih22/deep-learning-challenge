Summary:
The deep learning model shows promise but may require further tuning to meet performance expectations. While the model achieved a training accuracy of approximately 73%, the evaluation metrics suggest the need for optimization to achieve better generalization. Future exploration could involve alternative architectures like CNNs or RNNs, depending on data characteristics and classification requirements. Experimentation with various models and parameters is crucial for optimizing classification accuracy.
